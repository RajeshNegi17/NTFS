output/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ recovered/          # Active files

## Creating Image Files

If you need to create an image file from a physical drive, see `CREATE_IMAGE_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions using various tools like dd, FTK Imager, WinHex, etc.

## Troubleshooting

- **No files found**: Ensure your image file contains valid NTFS data
- **Recovery fails**: Check that the output directory is writable
- **GUI not responding**: The tool is processing large files - wait for completion
